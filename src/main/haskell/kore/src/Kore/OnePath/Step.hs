  deriving (Show)

{- | A pattern on which a rule can be applied or on which a rule was applied.

As an example, when rewriting

@
if x then phi else psi
@

with these rules

@
if true then x else y => x
if false then phi else psi
@

there would be two 'RewritePattern's, @phi and x=true@ and @psi and x=false@.

When rewriting the same pattern with an rule that does not match, e.g.

@
x + y => x +Int y
@

then the rewrite result should be 'Bottom'.

    | Bottom
    -- ^ special representation for a bottom rewriting/simplification result.

    -- differentiate between them and stuck results.

{- | Transition rule for primitive strategies in 'Prim'.

@transitionRule@ is intended to be partially applied and passed to
'Strategy.runStrategy'.

Note that this returns a disjunction of terms, while the one-path document
works with a conjunction. To understand why this works, let us note that
when using the document's algorithm we would get a conjunction of the type

@
∀ X . Φ1(X)→ •Ψ(B)
∧
∀ X . Φ2(X)→ •Ψ(B)
∧
...
∧
∀ X . Φn(X)→ •Ψ(B)
@

which is equivalent to

@
∀ X . (Φ1(X)→ •Ψ(B)) ∧ (Φ2(X)→ •Ψ(B)) ∧ ... ∧ (Φn(X)→ •Ψ(B))
@

But, since @(a → c) ∧ (b → c) = (a ∨ b) → c@, we can write the above as

@
∀ X . (Φ1(X) ∨ Φ2(X) ∨ ... ∨ Φn(X))→ •Ψ(B)
@

which is actually, exactly the form we want, since we are working with a
"current pattern" and a destination, not with n different current patterns
and n destinations.
