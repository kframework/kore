{-|'simplify' simplifies an 'And' of 'OrPattern'.

To do that, it first distributes the terms, making it an Or of And patterns,
each And having 'Pattern's as children, then it simplifies each of
those.

Since an Pattern is of the form term /\ predicate /\ substitution,
making an and between two Patterns roughly means and-ing each of their
components separately.

This means that a bottom component anywhere makes the result bottom, while
top can always be ignored.

When we 'and' two terms:
by Proposition 5.24 from (1),
    x and functional-pattern = functional-pattern and [x=phi]
We can generalize that to:
    x and function-pattern
        = function-pattern and ceil(function-pattern) and [x=phi]
        but note that ceil(function-pattern) is not actually needed.
We can still generalize that to:
    function-like-pattern1 and function-like-pattern2
        = function-pattern1 and function-pattern1 == function-pattern2
Also, we have
    constructor1(s1, ..., sk) and constructor2(t1, ..., tk):
        if constructor1 != constructor2 then this is bottom
        else it is
            constructor1(s1 and t1, ..., sk and tk)
    * constructor - 'inj' (sort injection) pairs become bottom
    * injection-injection pairs with the same injection work the same as
      identical constructors
    domain-value1 and domain-value1, where both are string-based:
        domain-value1 if they are equal
        bottom otherwise
    the same for two string literals and two chars

{- TODO (virgil): Preserve pattern sorts under simplification.

One way to preserve the required sort annotations is to make 'simplifyEvaluated'
take an argument of type

> CofreeF (And Sort) (Attribute.Pattern variable) (OrPattern variable)

instead of two 'OrPattern' arguments. The type of 'makeEvaluate' may
be changed analogously. The 'Attribute.Pattern' annotation will eventually
cache information besides the pattern sort, which will make it even more useful
to carry around.
