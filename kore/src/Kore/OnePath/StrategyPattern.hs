{- | A pattern on which a rule can be applied or on which a rule was applied.

As an example, when rewriting

@
if x then phi else psi
@

with these rules

@
if true  then u else v => u
if false then u else v => v
@

there would be two 'RewritePattern's, @phi and x=true@ and @psi and x=false@.
If only the first rule was present, the results would be a 'RewritePattern' with
@phi and x=true@ and a 'Remainder' with @psi and not x=true@.

When rewriting the same pattern with an rule that does not match, e.g.

@
x + y => x +Int y
@

then rewriting produces no children.
