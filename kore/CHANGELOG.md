## [0.20.0.0] - 2020-04-29

### Added

- Added documentation for the `--log-entries` option.

### Changed

- Clarified the message accompanying the "substitution coverage" error.

### Fixed

- The `smtlib` and `smt-hook` attributes handle SMT-LIB lists correctly.
  The argument of these attributes would not be instantiated correctly if it was
  a list, but SMT-LIB atoms were always handled correctly.

## [0.19.0.0] - 2020-04-15

### Added

- Added options for debugging equation application:
  - `--debug-attempt-equation`
  - `--debug-apply-equation`
  - `--debug-equation`
- Added log entry types:
  - `DebugApplyEquation`
  - `DebugAttemptEquation`

### Changed

- Applying equation-based rules (primarily function rules and simplification rules) is more efficient.
- Equations may not have free variables occurring only on the right-hand side.
- Command-line options that expect a module name check that their argument is a _valid_ module name.
- The log displays the context of each entry.
- The log displays the _type_ of each context to be used with option `--log-entries` for more information.
- The format of parsing and validation errors is more similar to other parsers and compilers.

### Removed

- Removed options for debugging equation application:
  - `--debug-applied-rule`
  - `--debug-simplification-axiom`
  - `--debug-simplification-axiom-patterns`
- Removed log entry types:
  - `DebugAppliedRule`
  - `DebugAxiomEvaluation`
  - `DebugSkipSimplification`
