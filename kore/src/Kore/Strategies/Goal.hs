{- NOTE: Non-deterministic semantics

The current implementation of one-path verification assumes that the proof goal
is deterministic, that is: the proof goal would not be discharged during at a
non-confluent state in the execution of a non-deterministic semantics. (Often
this means that the definition is simply deterministic.) As a result, given the
non-deterministic definition

> module ABC
>   import DOMAINS
>   syntax S ::= "a" | "b" | "c"
>   rule [ab]: a => b
>   rule [ac]: a => c
> endmodule

this claim would be provable,

> rule a => b [claim]

but this claim would **not** be provable,

> rule a => c [claim]

because the algorithm would first apply semantic rule [ab], which prevents rule
[ac] from being used.

We decided to assume that the definition is deterministic because one-path
verification is mainly used only for deterministic semantics and the assumption
simplifies the implementation. However, this assumption is not an essential
feature of the algorithm. You should not rely on this assumption elsewhere. This
decision is subject to change without notice.

This instance contains the default implementation for a one-path strategy. You
can apply it to the first two arguments and pass the resulting function to
'Kore.Strategies.Verification.verify'.

Things to note when implementing your own:

1. The first step does not use the reachability claims

2. You can return an infinite list.

{- | Check the claim by direct implication.

The claim has the form

@
φ(X) → ∘ ∃ Y. ⋁ᵢ ψᵢ(X, Y)

where @∘ _@ is a modality in reachability logic. @φ@ and the @ψᵢ@ are assumed to
be function-like patterns. @X@ and @Y@ are disjoint families of
variables. @checkImplicationWorker@ checks the validity of the formula

@
⌊ φ(X) → ∃ Y. ⋁ᵢ ψᵢ(X, Y) ⌋

Let @φ(X) = t(X) ∧ P(X)@ and @ψᵢ(X, Y) = tᵢ(X, Y) ∧ Pᵢ(X, Y)@; then the
implication formula above is valid when

(⋀ᵢ ¬ ∃ Y. ⌈t(X) ∧ tᵢ(X, Y)⌉ ∧ Pᵢ(X, Y)) ∧ ⌈t(X)⌉ ∧ P(X)

is unsatisfiable. This predicate basically consists of two parts: a single positive
conjunct asserting that the left-hand side of the claim is satisfiable:

@
⌈t(X)⌉ ∧ P(X)
@

and many negative conjuncts arising from the unification of the left- and
right-hand sides:

⋀ᵢ ¬ ∃ Y. ⌈t(X) ∧ tᵢ(X, Y)⌉ ∧ Pᵢ(X, Y)
@

When the implication formula is valid, @checkImplicationWorker@ returns
'Implied'. When the implication formula is not valid, we apply the following
heuristic:

* If any of the unification problems @⌈t(X) ∧ tᵢ(X, Y)⌉@ succeeded,
  @checkImplicationWorker@ returns 'NotImpliedStuck',
* otherwise, it returns 'NotImplied'.

Returing 'NotImpliedStuck' has the effect of terminating the proof. This
heuristic prevents the prover from executing beyond the intended final program
state ("inventing" programs), but at the cost that it does prevent the prover
from visiting the final program state twice. In practice, we find that deductive
proofs should not require the prover to visit the final program state twice,
anyway.
