Module      : Kore.Step.Axiom.Identifier
Description : Data structures and manipulation helpers used for axiom
              evaluation identifiers.

              The expectation is that an axiom can be applied to a term
              only if the identifier of its left-hand-side is the same
              as the term's identifier.

Returns Nothing if it will not handle the current pattern.

Currently parameters of parameterized symbols are ignored.
