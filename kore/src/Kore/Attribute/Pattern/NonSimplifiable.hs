{- | A pattern is 'NonSimplifiable' if:
    1. it's a 'BuiltinBool', 'BuiltinInt', 'BuiltinString' or a 'StringLiteral'
    2. a constructor or a domain value of a non-hooked sort applied over
    a 'NonSimplifiable' pattern
    3. a sort injection applied over a 'NonSimplifiable' pattern 'pat',
    where 'pat' does not also have a sort injection at the top.
